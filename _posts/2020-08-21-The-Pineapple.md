## Introduction

I once took a visual class in my undergraduate, and today I found the paintings I created on that class occasionally.
I think I should upload them here and so I do. 
At that course the professor asked me to select something in my daily life and then to draw some paintings based on it from complex to simple.
The idea comes from the famous artwork **The Bull** created by Pablo Picasso and obviously the professor wanted me to finish a same kind of paintings in series.
Boring idea, I thought at that time, though the idea is quite old-fashioned it is a compulsory course so I have to try my best to achieve that.
As pineapple is easy to find in the store of my university and it looks quite nature, I finally decide to choose it.
Below are some paintings I create based on it.

## Type A

## Type B

I then tried to do some more modern ways to create my artwork.
Inspired by the great artist Yves Klein I tried a similar way to paint by pressing the pineapple dipped in ink on the white paper and
then pulling for multiple times. I have to say the outcome is really attractive.
