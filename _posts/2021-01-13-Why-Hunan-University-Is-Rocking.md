Though I have to say that once before I once hated being in Hunan University(mostly because of some political
reasons and its bureaucratism atmosphore in some parts), I do want to list the points which make the university
unique and a rocky place to live in.

#Points to make it rock!

## 1.NO WALL!

Yes. The campus does not have any wall, which make it rather unique in Asian. There are many residential apartments
in the campus and is also open for the tourists. Anyway, you will not feel like being put in a jail while studying here.


## 2.WOHOOO, TWO SUBWAY LINES!

Yes. It indeed has TWO SUBWAY LINES in the campus! Big vectory for railway trasportation lovers! You can take the subway
from the school library to the school dormitory or just go to any other places in the city, to have lunch/dinner, to the 
airport or train station, or just find somewhere to have fun!

## 3.20 MINUTES TO DOWNTOWN!

Good news for shopping lovers, it is only 20 minutes to the shopping center in Changsha city. You can find many great
resturants, big malls and luxury stores there.(also, many hot ladies and fashion young people!)

## 4.CITY SKYLINE

Good news for urban lovers! You can have a good view of the skyline of Changsha city in some upper floors of some school buildings
in the university. 

## 5.FANTASTIC HEATED SWIMMING POOL
 
 Just need to pay a dinner's price and you can go to the heated swmming pool to have a relax! Definitely a great place for swimming lovers
 and a good way to keep fit! Even better in the winter(feels like taking a bath in hot spring)
 
## 6.BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS
 
Though I feel not so good about Changsha city itself, I have to acknowledge that Hunan University probablly has one of the most beautiful 
campus in the world!(if there are not so many people walking in the campus!) Some buildings in the campus are built in the 1930s, which 
make the campus a feeling of history. Also, there are many trees, and some mountains around the campus, you can always find clouds surrounded the mountain. 

## 7.FRIENDLY PROFESSORS

Yes, most of the professors are kind, warm hearted people who really care about their students! Though there are few jerks there, you can always find more
professors there who are knowledgeable with colorful life experience, great passion to teach and time to listen to and help their students make success!

## 8.GROWNING REPUTATION

The ranking of Hunan University is greatly rising these years.
According to the latest mainstream rankings(2021), it is ranked:  
[252 in USNEWS Best Globa 2021l Universities](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/hunan-university-505375),  
[401-500 in THE World 2021](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2021/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats)
[201-300 in ARWU World 2020](http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html)
[601-650 in QS World 2020](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/hunan-university/more)

Yes, it is not even at the top level but yes, it is growing these years! At least, not a bad place to do research!

## 9.FAST GROWING COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM

The CS department here is not in the 1st tire of China, but also it is growing veeeery fast these years. Some of the top undergraduate students here go to some famous schools
like John Hopkins University, UT Austin, New York University, University of Tokyo, Tsinghua University and Peking University to do their graduate studies! Some choose to go
to some top tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent, Bytedance and Meituan to start their careers! So yes, you can surely find some talented students here.  
According to [CSRankings](http://csrankings.org/), it is ranked around 50 in Asia in general, ** 106 in the world from 2020 to 2021 (FAST GROWING!) **, and about 55 in the world
for Embedded & real-time systems, and 56 in the world for Design automation.  

## 10.DECENT DESIGN PROGRAM

The school of design here is probablly one of the best design schools here! You can always meet some interesting creative students here full of energy! Some are people with leadership
while otheres are cool geeks! It is ranked 5 in design here according to the Chinese Ministry of Education! Some top undergraudate students go to URL, RCA, UW, CMU and Keio to do their
further studies. Others do go to some top design companies to start their careers and also there are some alumnus who make great achievement in the field of design. (Regardless the fact 
that the design school may not as good as its ranking,) It is one of the top design schools here in any means.
