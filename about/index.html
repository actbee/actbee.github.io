			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is Xuedan Zou (Daniel/Dan). I am currently a software engineer at Rakuten Group based in Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.</a>
			   I did my graduate school at Dartmouth College with a focus on Digital Arts, Computer Science. Before, I finished my bachelor study both in Computer Science and Industrial
            Design at <a href="https://actbee.github.io/blog/2021/01/13/Why-Hunan-University-Is-Rocking">Hunan University</a>. 
			    During my graduate study at Dartmouth College, I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~lorie/About.html">Prof. Lorie Loeb</a> and <a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/elizabeth-murnane">Prof. Elizabeth L. Murnane</a>.
				My <a href="https://xuedanzougr.wixsite.com/triple-helix">thesis</a> which was chosen as one of the Arts Integration Initiative projects by Hopkins Center for the Arts at Dartmouth College, explores the potential new relationship between the artist, the audiences and the artworks in an exhibition environment. <br>

				I enojy art, design, and Tokyo, viewing it as a life-time hobby. My artworks were exhibited in multiple places like New Asian Generation Design Exhibition(2020), Junction Arts&Media(2023), Dartmouth College(2023) and AVA Gallery and Art Center(2023). In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the city Tokyo.
