            At this time, his mainly interests lie in Human Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. Recently he is working on the way using AI to make 
            the design process friendier and more effective to designers.			<br>
			
            Less academically, he is also interested in most video games (real gamer since he was about 3), mangas, graphic novels and great music (mostly city pop)! Also he is a fan of the city Tokyo and its wonderful rail transportation
            system. Maybe a Geek? ^--^ (below is the お茶の水 in 1986, really cool)</p>
