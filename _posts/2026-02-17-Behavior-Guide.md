## Behavior Guideline: Crucial Conversations:Tools for Talking When Stakes Are.

Below are some key take aways after finishing the book Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High (https://www.amazon.co.jp/Crucial-Conversations-Tools-Talking-Stakes/dp/1469266822).

It could be considered as a behavior guide within the team when such crucial conversations happen.



### 1.When will the crucial conversation happen?
"Crucial Conversations" provides invaluable tools for navigating complex human interactions characterized by high stakes, strong emotions, and differing opinions. The core objective is to build a "Pool of Shared Meaning", allowing for the free flow of information to achieve mutual understanding and preserve relationships.

That means, if the conversation topic is important, and the people inside the conversation hold very different prospectives, and they are emotional, then the crucial conversation happens and this guide should help for such occasions.



### 2.How to start the crucial conversation?
Before starting the conversation, critically examine your true intentions. Ask yourself to clarify your purpose:

What do I want for myself?
What do I want for the other person?
What do I want for the relationship?
To achieve such goal, how should I do?
Anyway, always understand your true purpose for this conversation.

Be alert to signals of a wrong topic: escalating emotions in a bad way, nagging doubts, or a sense of familiarity(find out you are discussing about the same topic with the same person).

Utilize the CPR framework (Content, Pattern, Relationship) to identify the level of the issue.
Content layer → Should the issue happen the first time?
Pattern layer → Or it has happened multiple times and it is a pattern?
Relationship layer → Or, this is between the relationship of people, not just one single case or single behavior?

Condense the problem into a "brief statement" to stay focused.

During the conversation, if the other side makes you consider to change the topic temporally, set a bookmark so you could switch back to the original topic later. Some words like "oh you must be sad about breaking up with your girlfriend. Let's talk about your emotion first then we could discuss about the hotfix." or "This is really serious and urgent since we need to do the hotfix within 30 min. I understand you are not feeling well now but let's discuss with the hotfix first, then we could go with your break up."

When angry, fearful, or hurt, conversations often derail. Recognize the chain: "Observation → Form an idea → Feeling" To change your feeling, you need to change the idea in your mind. To do this, you need to:

Focus on behavior: Are you acting out your emotion instead of speaking candidly?
Use words to describe the emotion: Find out what is the emotion that cause you to behave in this way. Use the word to describe this emotion.
Analyze the idea: Keep asking what is the idea behind your current emotion.
Seek facts: Differentiate between facts and your interpretations. Challenge negative ideas by finding objective evidence that confirms or disproves them. Focus on the reality, not your judgement!

### 3.How to conduct the crucial conversation?
The success of a crucial conversation hinges on creating a safe environment. The discussion contents (what you are discussing about) and the vibe (the way you discuss) should be fully concerned. Monitor the atmosphere for signs of violated safety, such as Silence (masking, avoiding, withdrawing) or Violence (controlling, labeling, attacking). When safety is threatened, pause the content discussion and prioritize restoring safety.

When you notify the conversation is not in a safe environment, you should stop the current discussion and make additional efforts to rebuild the safe environment. To build this safe environment, you need  to make your opposite believe that:
1. Mutual Purpose: you care about their concerns
2. Mutual Respect: you care about them

Typical ways to rebuild safe environment could be:
1. Demonstrate your positive intent.
2. Apologize in a timely and appropriate way.
3. Clarify to prevent any misunderstanding
4. Establish the mutual purpose

When the opposite misunderstands your purpose, you can try to use contrasting: Denying what you don't intend, and Affirming what you do intend. to clarify misunderstandings. Like you can make a statement in this way "Sorry but I don't intend to ....., in fact my purpose is to ......".

To build a mutual purpose, follow these steps:

Commit to Shared Solutions: Clearly express your dedication to finding a solution that satisfies both parties. (e.g., "I'm committed to discussing this until we find a mutually satisfying outcome.")
Identify Core Motives: Look beyond stated strategies to understand the underlying reasons and true objectives driving the other person's position. Ask "why" they want what they're asking for.
Elevate the Goal: If current individual goals conflict, seek a higher, broader, or longer-term objective that encompasses both parties' interests.
Co-create a Win-Win Strategy: Jointly brainstorm and agree on a new approach that benefits everyone involved. (e.g., "What if we tried X, which would allow you to achieve [benefit 1] and me to achieve [benefit 2]?")


When you make the statement for your view which might cause conflicts, it is important to keep the environment safe. Use the STATE method here (a comprehensive approach):

Share your facts (start with the least controversial).
Tell your story (your interpretation/conclusion).
Ask for others' paths (invite their views).
Talk tentatively (use softening language like "I'm beginning to wonder if...", "Perhaps...", say this is your thoughts and might not be the fact).
Encourage testing (be open to having your views challenged).
Don't pile up problems or apologize for your valid opinions.

Also, you need to explore others' path. This requires you to do the active listening:

Self-reflection: Prepare yourself to truly listen.
Encourage exploration: Create safety for others to share their underlying motivations and stories.
Listening skills （AMPP）: Ask to hear their views, confirm their feelings, Mirror (repeat words to show you're listening), Paraphrase (restate in your own words), and Prime (offer a guess if they're stuck).
Handle Disagreements: Find points of Agreeing (where you truly concur), Adding (sharing additional information), and Comparing (exploring differences with an open, tentative approach). You could go with
"Yes I truly agree with your point that xxxxxx. In addition, I do notify that ........ So maybe we hold a little bit different views on this, from my perspective it is like ...... + STATE statement"
When faced with harsh feedback, employ the CURE model: Collect yourself (be calm), Understand (ask the opposite to take some examples, and then listen), Recover (ask for a pause if needed), and Engage (identify what's true/acceptable and calmly respond).

### 4.How to end the crucial conversation?
Before ending a conversation, both sides should determine "who decides" and communicate the decision-making method (Command, Consult, Vote, and Consensus).  Ensure the right people are involved: those who are concerned, informed, supported, and engaged. The goal is to involve the minimum number of people while securing sufficient support for high-quality decisions. Also, please involve some people with rights/influence in the organization to involve in the decision making (so they will not disagree with you in public potentially). After the decision-making method is decided, be sure to announce it to all of the other members.

Use the WWWF framework for clear commitments:

Who: Assign specific individuals to tasks. Each part of the tasks should have a PIC.
What: Define the purpose for the action.
When: Set clear deadlines/check points.
Follow-Up: Establish how progress will be monitored and accountability ensured.
Finally, make people to commit responsibility for their part.
Summarize the conversation and confirm mutual understanding, especially concerning action plans. Keep records and review them at key junctures (e.g., team meetings)



In the end, Crucial conversations are not zero-sum games. By observing carefully, creating and maintaining safety, and engaging in honest, respectful dialogue, information flows freely, leading to better decisions, stronger relationships, and ultimately, win-win outcomes. Furthermore, when problems arise, achieving positive results hinges on promptly addressing issues, minimizing the time between their discovery and the initiation of discussion and resolution.
